Digital mixer implemented in python3 with an arduino esplora

Dependencies:
Arduino Esplora to load firmware onto
Numpy

I used an article from Basti's Scratchpad on the Internet to 
figure out the real time audio processing. While my application
did not require cython, here is his blog post for anybody who
needs it.
